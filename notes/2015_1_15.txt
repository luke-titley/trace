Time estimates for getting the renderer into shape.

2 : Add support for progressive rendering with qt.
1 : Simplify the irradience caching to sample just a lower resolution image.
1 : Add support for a camera matrix.
2 : Add support for shaders written in c++ and per triangle shader assignment.
2 : Write a pure C API for trace.
1 : Write a ctypes python API on top of that.
1 : Create a VERY simple exporter from blender to trace.
2 : Add support for importing UVs. 
2 : Add support for importing normals.
C : Implement some half decent importance sampling to speed up renders.
1 : Add support for pixel iterators which specify where we will be creating samples.
5 : Refactor and tidy messy areas of code. Ensure comments are correct and seperation lines are all the right length.

Two weeks if I have the evening free every night for the next two weeks.


C = Coffee (I don't know how long it will take)
The numbers are evenings.
