Plan
* Tidy up the qtrace code ready for sharing.
* Produce unit tests for everything.
* Ensure docs cover everything.
* Alignment for the Vector3 type.
    This page implies that alignment if data types on intel and amd is no longer
    such a performance hit.

        "The address of a block returned by malloc or realloc in GNU systems is
        always a multiple of eight (or sixteen on 64-bit systems). If you need a
        block whose address is a multiple of a higher power of two than that, use
        aligned_alloc or posix_memalign. aligned_alloc and posix_memalign are
        declared in stdlib.h."
* Refactor to support progressive rendering.
* Thread safe queue.

Wish list
* Efficient image display in qt.
* Thread safe queue for more efficient use of threading.
* Unit tests for everything.
* Code tidy up and docs.
* CUDA
* SSE
