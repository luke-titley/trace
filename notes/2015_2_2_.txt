Have abandoned iradiance caching and global illumination for the time being,
as ambient occlusion still produces a nice result and is much quicker to compute.
Once KDTree is quick enough, will try a second attempt at global illumination
rendering.

TODO:
* Find the performance problem in scene::trace, it seems to be slowing down
    exponentially.
* Implement smarter kdtree splitting algorithm, using costing introduced in
    Realtime Rendering.
