This directory contains the source code for a hobby ray tracer written by
Luke Titley.

This will build on ubuntu with g++ 9.
trace has very few dependencies and requires one library outside of a standard
ubuntu build. libpng is included and is built as part of the building of trace,
however libpng requires zlib to be installed.

Building
========
    To build, run unit tests and kick off a quick test render type:
        make

    Once rendering is complete there should be a file called 'out.png' in the
    current directory.

    To build just the stand alone command line ray tracer type:
        make trace

    To build and run just the unit tests type:
        make tests

    To generate qtcreator 2.4.1 project files type:
        make qtproject


Running
=======
You can run it like this.

```bash
./trace --render --samplesPerPixel 25 --inputFilename ../obj/boatForRender.obj  && display out.png
```

Docs
    doxygen generated documentation can be found in 'docs/html' in the current
    directory.
