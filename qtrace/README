This directory contains a tiny qt application that progressively renders an
image and displays it whilst it's being rendered. The application links to
libtrace in the neighbour directory.

This application requires Qt 4.8.4 to be installed.

The simplest way to build this application is via qtcreator.
Opening up qtrace.pro in qtcreator and hitting build. The project contains an
rpath reference to the libtrace so it should run without any LD_LIBRARY_PATH
hacks.

Alternatively cd into qtrace-build-desktop-Qt_4_8_1_in_PATH__System__Release
and type 'make'.
